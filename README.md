This project started as a personal tool. I was working on an Elasticsearch API and needed to be alerted when it went down. After building something that worked for my purposes, I began thinking it would be interesting to work more on it - I wanted to generalize it to work on any type API. I wanted to put some love into the UI and make something that looked and felt good to use. I wanted to do so focusing on the base technologies - Node/Express and Vanilla Javascript. Thus API Uptime Monitor was born.
